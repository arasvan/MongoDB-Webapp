# Web abb connected to a MongoDB database;

This is a simple web app I made as part of my course;

The front end is made with Vue, find it in the 'Client' folder;

Node.js used to make the server, located in the 'Server' folder;

Database hosted using MongoDB Atlas;

The whole thing was hosted on Heroku, until they took it down because of inactivity;
